SP4E: Homework 2

Explanations regarding Exercise 6 : 

Explanations as comments will be added to the code for instance for the constructor and the difference in the structure of constructing computepi,sum and the integral which takes multiple inputs including a function.

The code is finalised in a manner that the user can choose either to compute the series of summation, pi , or the integral for a given function.
If integral option is chosen, then the user choses among the options of the 3 functions as represented by numbers.
Once the function is chosen then the code asks the user to input the limits.


6.4 : Expected values are achieved, more detailed analysis will be done as asked.
